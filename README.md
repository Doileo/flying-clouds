## My process

### Built with

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and animation
- CSS `@keyframes` for animation effects
- `border-radius` and `box-shadow` for cloud styling

### What I learned

In this project, I delved into several CSS techniques:

- Learned to use `@keyframes` to animate the clouds across the screen.
- Applied `border-radius` and `box-shadow` to create realistic fluffy clouds.
- Experimented with different animation speeds and paths to achieve a natural drifting effect.

### Continued development

In future updates, I plan to:

- Add more interactive elements or user controls.
- Enhance the realism of the cloud animations with more complex CSS properties.
- Explore integrating JavaScript for additional functionality or interactivity.
